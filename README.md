# Hues-and-cues-grader

Have you ever been shitfaced at 1 AM screaming at your friends over whether or not "Tangerine" is a proper shade of orange that coorelates to the f7 space in the hit board game, hues and cues, which led to a poorly enunciated screaming match over the intracies of color theory, fruit, visual qualia, and most importanty, your consistent sexual relations with their mother?

Well, do I have an extremely convoluted, mostly objective, entirely correct answer available for you to use in a bout of schadenfreude as you make your opponents tremble in your color guessing opalescence

This tool, when used professionally, will automatically use your self-hosted stable diffusion server, which you definitely have, to generate 10 images of the word, or words, you gave as an answer in the midst of your game of hues and cues.

It will then prompt you for the row and column of your space, take the average color of the 10 generated images, and make a direct RGB comparison, then spit out nothing but objective truth, a truth so prominent and profound it makes the Gettysburg address look like your grade-school presentation on paper-mache volcanoes..

Setup tutorial:
